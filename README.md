# resume!

Inspired by [`dcousineau/resume`](https://github.com/dcousineau/resume) -- especially the clever strategy of using `releases` as an archive of various "built" states over time.

If you're on a mac, `brew cask install mactex && pdflatex resume.tex`

TODO: write readme about tagging and automated releases
